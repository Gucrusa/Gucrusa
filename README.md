# Hi, I'm Rosa 👋

**Geospatial Data Scientist · Agricultural Engineer · PhD Candidate in Physics of Complex Systems**

I work at the intersection of **remote sensing, geospatial data science and agriculture**, building models and tools that help make cropping systems more **resilient, sustainable and climate-aware**.

- 🌱 Background in **Agricultural Engineering** (BSc + MSc, University of Córdoba – ETSIAM)  
- 📊 **Master’s in Data Science** (EUMC)  
- 🧠 **PhD in Physics of Complex Systems** (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid) – ongoing  
- 🌍 Currently in a Stay as **doctoral researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)**, working on nonlinear dynamics of agri-food systems using Vegetation Index time series. 
---

## What I work on

- **Geospatial & remote sensing for agriculture**  
  - Satellite time series (Sentinel-2, Landsat, MODIS), soil and climate data for **crop monitoring, yield estimation and dynamics analysis**.  
  - Landscape-scale models to understand how agricultural systems respond to climate variability.
    
- **Machine learning & complex systems**  
  - Classification, clustering, anomaly detection and time-series modelling (including **Recurrence Plots** and **reservoir computing**).  
  - Nonlinear dynamics of agri-food systems and resilience analysis. 

- **Applied agricultural projects**  
  - **Irrigated olive groves mapping** with ML and Sentinel-2 – published in *Land (MDPI)*.  
  - **Soil health & climate-resilient landscapes** (ICOSHELLS – EU Horizon Europe).  
  - **Digital tools for crop planning under price uncertainty** (Innovation Challenge of Agricultural Economy – La Vega Innova, Next Generation EU).  
  - Multi-country **food safety and contaminant monitoring** for major European retailers (Kaufland, Aldi, Lidl, Rewe).

## Selected roles

- 🛰 **PhD Stay – Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)**  
  - Advanced time-series analysis (Recurrence Plot) on satellite-derived NDVI to characterise        pasture dynamics and climate-related variability in Northern Spain.

- 🌾 **Data Scientist – Agrowingdata** (remote)  
  - Geospatial ML for irrigated olive groves (Sentinel-2 + climate).  
  - AI and complex systems for modelling the European horticultural market (Cereals).  
  - EU-funded projects on soil health and climate resilience. 

- 🧪 **Project Analyst – Analytica Alimentaria GmbH**  
  - Pesticide and contaminant monitoring across EU, Africa, Asia and South America
  - GIS-based cadmium risk zoning in avocado and pomegranate
  - Field trials in citrus and grapes.

## Tech stack

- **Geospatial & EO:** GeoPandas, Rasterio, QGIS, Folium/Leaflet, Google Earth Engine  
- **ML & time series:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Recurrence Plots, seasonal forecasting, reservoir computing  
- **Data & backends:** Python, R, SQL/NoSQL, Hadoop, Spark, MongoDB, Azure  
- **Visualisation:** Power BI, Superset

## How I like to work

- Bridging **field realities** (growing up close to farming and working with producers/retailers) with **advanced modelling**.  
- Turning complex geospatial and time-series models into **transparent, usable tools** for agronomists, growers and decision-makers.  
- Collaborating in **interdisciplinary and international teams** across academia, industry and EU projects.
